This portfolio explores the design and development of a biomimetic artefact inspired by the manta ray, using sketching, CAD modelling, haptic sculpting, and physical prototyping. The aim was to replicate the fluid motion and organic form of the manta ray while showcasing modern digital fabrication techniques.

Hand-drawn conceptual sketches
Haptic pen-based digital sculpting
Onshape CAD modelling
3D printing & resin molding
Motion simulation for fluid dynamics
Dedicated gallery pages for each stage
Integrated literature review and reflection

Today's Progress

- Completed and polished Stage 1 gallery page (`stage1-gallery.html`)
- Linked the Stage 1 gallery to the main portfolio page without affecting layout
- Integrated haptic pen section with dynamic gallery support and modal functionality
- Set up modal-based image galleries for multiple prototype stages
- Refined the reflection section styling to match the overall page layout
- Added “Back to Main Page” and “Back to Section” navigation buttons in galleries
- Prepared README structure and outlined key accomplishments
- Pushed all changes to GitHub with version-controlled commits
