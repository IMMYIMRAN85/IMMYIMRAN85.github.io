        Inspired by the effortless elegance of the manta ray, this project aims to recreate its fluid form and natural movement using advanced 3D modelling techniques and robotics. The manta ray’s unique shape and swimming patterns offer valuable insights into streamlined design and efficient locomotion.

     <p style="max-width: 700px; text-align: left;">
      Using Fusion 360, we have embarked on a journey of biomimicry — a design approach that learns from nature to solve human challenges. By digitally sculpting the manta ray's anatomy, we aim to understand the balance between form, structure, and functionality in nature.
    </p>

     <p style="max-width: 700px; text-align: left;">
      The ultimate goal is to develop a robotic skin prototype that reflects the manta ray’s graceful movement while exploring potential real-world applications in underwater robotics, design innovation, and sustainable technologies.

							<h2>Stage 1: Initial Concept and Sketching</h2>
							<p>In the first stage, the design process began with conceptual exploration and freehand sketching. The aim was to capture the fluid, organic motion of the manta ray and translate it into a visual design language. Through brainstorming and rough drafts, the form, purpose, and potential features of the artefact were outlined.</p>

							<h2>Stage 2: Creating the Virtual Prototype</h2>
							<p>The next step was to create a 3D model using CAD software. This allowed us to refine the design and simulate its movement digitally.</p>
							<p>
							Once the concept was refined, a digital model was developed using 3D design software. This stage allowed for greater precision and exploration of surface textures, proportions, and functionality. The virtual prototype helped visualize how the manta ray artefact would appear in real-life and prepared the groundwork for physical production.

							<h2>Stage 3: Physical Prototype and Testing</h2>
							<p>With the digital prototype finalized, we proceeded to 3D print the first physical model and began testing for functionality and aesthetics.</p>
							<p>
							The final stage involved producing a tangible version of the artefact using 3D printing or handcrafted materials. Testing was conducted to evaluate its form, stability, and user interaction. This hands-on iteration was crucial in refining the final design and identifying any improvements needed.

						<section>
							<span class="icon solid major fa-cogs"></span>
							<h3>Traditional Model-Making</h3>
							<p>For certain parts, traditional techniques such as foam carving and resin molding were used to test different shapes and material flexibility.</p>
						</section>

							<span class="icon solid major fa-cogs"></span>
							<h3>Motion Simulation</h3>
							<p>To study the manta ray’s movement, we simulated its aerodynamics and tested how the prototype moved in response to various forces.</p>

					<h2>Reflection/Literature Review</h2>
					<p>Reflecting on the development process, several aspects of the workflow could be improved. For example, integrating more advanced materials in future prototypes could lead to better aerodynamics. Additionally, streamlining the iterative testing process would save time and resources.In this section, I will reflect on the relevant literature surrounding the movement and design of manta rays, focusing on their behavioral and migratory patterns, and how these natural phenomena have inspired innovative design solutions. Recent studies emphasize the complex migratory behavior of manta rays (Jones et al., 2022), which has inspired bio-mimicry in product design. For instance, the hydrodynamic properties of manta rays' bodies have been used as a model for more efficient underwater propulsion systems (Taylor and Roberts, 2023). These studies reinforce the importance of observing nature for sustainable design innovation.
					Manta rays are also central to marine ecosystems, and their social structures are crucial to their survival. Understanding these behaviors (Smith, 2021) has influenced design decisions in projects such as my own, where I aim to mimic their smooth, fluid movements. Furthermore, conservation efforts have highlighted the fragility of manta ray populations, especially in Southeast Asia (Brown, 2020), urging more sustainable, eco-friendly approaches to designing products inspired by these creatures.</p>
